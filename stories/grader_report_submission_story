Story: Grader report submitting

  As a grader
  I want to submit and preview a report

  Scenario: Grader submits and previews a report, and the preview page shows up properly.

    Given a logged in grader with ungraded report
    When the grader submits a report for previewing
    Then he should be redirected to the preview page
