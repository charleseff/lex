Story: Grader changes settings in the account settings page.

  As a grader
  I want to add or remove preferred grade levels.

  Scenario: Remove preferred grade levels and see that it corresponds

    Given a logged in grader with grades 1, 3, and 7 as preferred grade levels

    When the grader removes grade 3 and 1 as a preferred grade level

    Then there should be only grade level 7 checked off as preferred grade level
