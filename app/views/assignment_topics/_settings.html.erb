Examine the importance of the bookâ€™s setting.  Consider these questions: does the setting change?  How does the setting affect the story?  How do the characters interact with the setting?  How is the setting related to the conflict and/or the resolution of the story?  Keep in mind that some stories are better for this topic than others!  Your thesis should discuss how the author uses setting in his or her story.  Be sure to support your thesis with specific examples.
