Describe how the author portrays a character.  Some characters are presented in a way that makes the reader like them and sympathize with them.  On the other hand, some characters are presented in a way that makes the reader dislike, or even hate, them.  Often times, your opinion about the character changes as the story develops and as you learn more about the character.  Reflect on the following questions: how does the author’s portrayal of the character stay the same or change?  What specific events cause the reader to change his opinion about the character?  Your thesis should describe the character’s portrayal, and your essay should explore how the author influences the reader’s opinion of the character.
