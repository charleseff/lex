Trace a character’s development throughout the book.  The character can be the protagonist, antagonist, or another supporting character. Some questions to consider are the following: what problems does the character face?  How does the character respond to these problems?  How does he or she change as a result?  Make sure to come up with a clear thesis that describes the character’s development and to support your thesis using details from the book.
