Trace an important symbol in the story.  Some questions to consider are the following: is there an object in the story that has a significant, underlying meaning?  When does the symbol appear or disappear?  What does the symbol mean?  Do the characters interact with the symbol?  Your thesis should describe the symbol’s meaning, and your essay should examine the symbol’s role in the story.
