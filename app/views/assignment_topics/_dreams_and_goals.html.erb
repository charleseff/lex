Discuss a character’s dreams, desires, and/or goals.  Think about what the character plans to do to achieve his or her dreams?  How does the reality of the character’s situation compare to what the character wants?  Does the character eventually achieve his or her dream or does the dream change or die?  Your thesis should address one or more of these questions.  Use specific events in the book to develop your essay and support your thesis.
